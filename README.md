# My Curriculum Vitae

## Website

The app is accessible at [link](https://austin-cv.herokuapp.com).
The loading will take a while because it's hosted on Heroku.

This is an online version of my CV to have a better experience compared to a CV in pdf.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to start the app and execute the following commands :

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
